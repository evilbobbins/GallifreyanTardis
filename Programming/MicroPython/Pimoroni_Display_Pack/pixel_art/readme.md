Drawing on the display via pixel grids

To draw the pixel art I find it best to draw it out in the included 20x20 grid excel file

exporting this to a csv then removing the , and adding a " at the start and a ", at the end of each line

This can then be turned in to a single line and used to draw the pixel art on the screen
