Container for my CircuitPython Code for Adafruit hardware

This container requires Adafruit CircuitPython: https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython

Some libs might be required to run to install drop them into the lib folder on the CIRCUITPY drive

Save code in code.py on your hardwares CIRCUITPY drive

the best way to work with CircuitPython is to use [Mu Editor](https://codewith.mu)
