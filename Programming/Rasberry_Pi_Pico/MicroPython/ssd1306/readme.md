Connecting up a ssd1306 oled screen

connecting up and displatying simple text on a ssd1306 oled screen
the scren i have is a dual colour 1/3 yellow and 2/3 blue
this will also work on single colour screens too

for this to run both the main.py and ssd1306.py files must be on the Pico

to do this in [Thonny](https://thonny.org) start by connecting the pico and creating a new file
Copy Main.py to the new file and save that to the Pico as main.py
create another new file and copy ssd1306.py to the new file and save it to the Pico as ssd1306.py
