Container for my MicroPython Code

This container requires Pimoroni's compiled version of [Micropython](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/blob/main/setting-up-micropython.md)

Save code in main.py on your Raspberry Pi Pico

the best way to work with MicroPython is to use [Thonny](https://thonny.org)
